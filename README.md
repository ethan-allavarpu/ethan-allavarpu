Hello, my name is Ethan Allavarpu. I am pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics Data Science at Stanford University. In June 2022, I graduated *summa cum laude* with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and completed the four-year degree program in three years.

Currently, I am a Data Science and Visualization Intern at Apple as a member of the DataViz team within Hardware Engineering. Additionally, I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Luby Lab](https://lubylab.stanford.edu), using statistical analyses and visualizations to improve brick kiln efficiency in South Asia. My fields of interest include technology, marketing, environmental science, sports, and healthcare.  My programming skillset includes Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I am always eager to contribute to research projects in whatever capacity possible.
