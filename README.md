Hello, my name is Ethan Allavarpu. I am pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics Data Science at Stanford University. In June 2022, I graduated *summa cum laude* (4.00 GPA) with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and completed the four-year degree program in three years.

My fields of interest include technology, marketing, sports, healthcare, political science. Next summer (2023), I will join Apple as a Data Science and Visualization Intern as a member of the DataViz team within Hardware Engineering. Currently, I am a Data Science Intern with Bridg working on natural language processing and statistical analyses. My programming skillset includes Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I am always eager to contribute to research and take on internships in the coming months.
