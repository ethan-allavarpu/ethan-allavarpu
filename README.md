Hello! My name is Ethan Allavarpu, and I am pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics Data Science at Stanford University. In June 2022, I graduated *summa cum laude* with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and completed the four-year degree program in three years. Currently, I am a Data Science Intern at Bridg and interned at Apple over the summer as a Data Science Intern. My programming skillset includes Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. I am always eager to contribute to research projects in whatever capacity possible.
